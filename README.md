# human_bingo
A simple tool for generating human bingo tiles, as for name-exchange introduction teambuilding game. The rules are simple: each participant gets a bingo tile and the one who fils a row, a column or a diagonal, wins. A field is filled by asking a preson with the requested feature to sign the upper half of the field. No one shall have two signtures of the same person in any row or any column or either diagonal, even if it is not the winning sequence. Tiles are not secret, but good habit has it that the players ask each other whther they posses a feature, rather than showing each other their tiles to choose a filed.  

Feel free to use the example ones in /fig, or create new ones calling "python main.py". 

By default 5*5 grid is populated with the features from "features.txt" without repetition. The example features should work for a general group. Be careful, line breaks are needed after 20 characters.
